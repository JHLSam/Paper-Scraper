te# Paper-Scraper
Web Scraper tool bundled with OCR features. 
MVC implementation in progress

**Self-Reminder: Fix ugly code(look into possibly slightly less data hard coding if possible). Clean up view instantiation if possible. 
Not necessary to take down, too many local copies to keep track. Base copy @ local["Paper-Scraper(minimal)"]
